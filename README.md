## Introduction

This project involves analyzing the World Happiness Report 2015 dataset. The dataset contains various metrics related to happiness scores, GDP per capita, family, health, freedom, trust, generosity, and more for different countries and regions.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. Load the dataset and display the first few rows.
2. Generate summary statistics.
3. Check for missing values.
4. Visualize the distribution of the 'Happiness Score'.


## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

1. Handle missing values (if any).
2. Detect and handle outliers.
3. Reset the index to start from 1.

## Basic Statistical Analysis

1. Calculate mean, median, and standard deviation.
2. Generate a correlation matrix and heatmap.


## Visualization

1. Create pair plots for relationships.
2. Create scatter plots for key variables.


## Feature Selection and Engineering

1. Select features and target for model training.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Apply polynomial features.


## Model Training and Evaluation

1. Train the linear regression model.
2. Predict on the testing data.
3. Evaluate the model.
4. Plot actual vs predicted values.

## Conclusion

In this project, we explored the World Happiness Report 2015 dataset, performed data cleaning and preprocessing, conducted basic statistical analysis, visualized key relationships, and selected important features. We built a linear regression model to predict the Happiness Score using selected features. Further feature engineering was performed by creating polynomial features, which resulted in improved model performance.
